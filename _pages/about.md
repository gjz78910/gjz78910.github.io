I'm currently a PhD student in [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/) 
at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/). I'm honored to be a member of the [<kbd>IDEAS Labotory</kbd>](https://ideas-labo.github.io/)
and be supervised by [Dr Tao Chen](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=K4teyvoAAAAJ&hl=en). 
My graduation time is probably in the early 2024.

My research topic is deep learning for software performance prediction. 
Iâ€™m passionate about this field because it has the potential to revolutionize the way we develop software. 
On this website, you can find more information about my research interests and projects. 
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
