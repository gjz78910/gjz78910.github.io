I'm currently a year-4 PhD student at [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/) at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/). My research topic is deep learning for software performance prediction. Iâ€™m passionate about this field because it has the potential to revolutionize the way we develop software. On this website, you can find more information about my research interests and projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate
