I'm currently a PhD student in [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/) 
at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/). I'm honored to be a member of the [<kbd>IDEAS Labotory</kbd>](https://ideas-labo.github.io/)
and be supervised by [Dr Tao Chen](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=K4teyvoAAAAJ&hl=en). My graduation time is probably in the early 2024.

My research topic is deep learning for software performance prediction. 
Iâ€™m passionate about this field because it has the potential to revolutionize the way we develop software. 

On this website, you can find more information about my research interests and projects. 
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

## Research Interests
My research interests are in applying **machine learning (deep learning)** to learn **software configurations and performance**. 
This involves modeling the complex relationship between the configurable options of the software and its performance metrics (such as latency, execution time, etc.) 
and accurately predicting the performance for any configuration. 

This way, software engineers and users can optimize the software to meet their design / execution requirements without spending much time on testing the software. 
Moreover, machine learning (deep learning) models can reduce the large amount of costs on performance measurements due to their high efficiency of learning.

## Backgrounds
I received my BSc from the [Information and Computing Science](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/undergraduate/information-and-computing-science)
programme at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/) (2014-16), and 
the [Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/2024/computer-science-bsc-hons) 
course at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) (2016-18).
