Tuning the parameters and prompts for improving AI-based
text-to-image generation has remained a substantial yet unaddressed
challenge. Hence we introduce GreenStableYolo, which improves the parameters
and prompts for Stable Diffusion to both reduce GPU inference
time and increase image generation quality using NSGA-II and Yolo.
Our experiments show that despite a relatively slight trade-off (18%)
in image quality compared to StableYolo (which only considers image
quality), GreenStableYolo achieves a substantial reduction in inference
time (266% less) and a 526% higher hypervolume, thereby advancing the
state-of-the-art for text-to-image generation.
