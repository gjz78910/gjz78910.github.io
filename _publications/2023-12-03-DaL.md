excerpt: 'Predicting the performance of highly configurable software systems is the foundation for performance testing and quality assurance. To that end, recent work has been relying on machine/deep learning to model software performance. However, a **crucial yet unaddressed challenge** is how to cater for the **sparsity** inherited from the configuration landscape: the influence of configuration options (features) and the distribution of data samples are highly sparse.
In this paper, we propose an approach based on the concept of 'divide-and-learn', dubbed *DaL*. The basic idea is that, to handle **sample sparsity**, we divide the samples from the configuration landscape into **distant divisions**, for each of which we build a **regularized Deep Neural Network** as the local model to deal with the **feature sparsity**. A newly given configuration would then be assigned to the right model of division for the final prediction.
Experiment results from eight real-world systems and five sets of training data reveal that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, *DaL* performs **no worse than the best counterpart on 33 out of 40 cases** (within which 26 cases are significantly better) with up to **1.94Ã—** improvement on accuracy; requires fewer samples to reach the same/better accuracy; and producing acceptable training overhead. Practically, *DaL* also considerably improves different global models when using them as the underlying local models, which further strengthens its flexibility. '
