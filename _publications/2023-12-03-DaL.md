In this paper, we propose an approach based on the concept of **'divide-and-learn'**, dubbed *DaL*. The basic idea is that, to handle **sample sparsity**, we divide the samples from the configuration landscape into distant divisions, for each of which we build a regularized Deep Neural Network as the local model to deal with the **feature sparsity**. A newly given configuration would then be assigned to the right model of division for the final prediction. Experiments on eight subject systems and five sample sizes have shown that *DaL* is state-of-the-art in 33 out of 40 cases.
