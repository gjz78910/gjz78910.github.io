In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
review exclusively on the topic of deep learning for performance learning of configurable software, covering
1,206 searched papers spanning six indexing services, based on which 99 primary papers were extracted and
analyzed. Our results outline key statistics, taxonomy, strengths, weaknesses, and optimal usage scenarios for
techniques related to the preparation of configuration data, the construction of deep learning performance
models, the evaluation of these models, and their utilization in various software configuration-related tasks.We
also identify the good practices and potentially problematic phenomena from the studies surveyed, together
with a comprehensive summary of actionable suggestions and insights into future opportunities within
the field.

To promote open science, all the raw results of this survey can be accessed at our [github repository](https://github.com/ideas-labo/DCPL-SLR).
