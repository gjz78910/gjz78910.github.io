Despite the presence of different encoding schemes, there is still **little understanding** of which is better and under what circumstances, as the community often relies on some general beliefs that inform the decision in an ad-hoc manner. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we empirically compared the **widely used encoding schemes** for software performance learning, namely label, scaled label, and one-hot encoding. The study covers five systems, seven models, and three encoding schemes, leading to 105 cases of investigation.
