Despite the presence of different encoding schemes, there is still **little understanding** of which is better and under what circumstances, as the community often relies on some general beliefs that inform the decision in an ad-hoc manner. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we empirically compared the **widely used encoding schemes** for software performance learning, namely label, scaled label, and one-hot encoding, with five systems, seven ML models, and three encoding schemes, leading to 105 cases of investigation. We show that it is non-trivial and expensive to select the encoding scheme, and we reveal important and actionable suggestions for future researchers.
